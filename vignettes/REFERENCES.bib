abstract = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions. {\textcopyright} 2005 ACM.},

@article{Akman2018,
abstract = {Researchers using ordinary differential equations to model phenomena face two main challenges among others: implementing the appropriate model and optimizing the parameters of the selected model. The latter often proves difficult or computationally expensive. Here, we implement Particle Swarm Optimization, which draws inspiration from the optimizing behavior of insect swarms in nature, as it is a simple and efficient method for fitting models to data. We demonstrate its efficacy by showing that it outstrips evolutionary computing methods previously used to analyze an epidemic model.},

@article{Sengupta2018,
abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic global optimization paradigm that has gained prominence in the last two decades due to its ease of application in unsupervised, complex multidimensional problems that cannot be solved using traditional deterministic algorithms. The canonical particle swarm optimizer is based on the flocking behavior and social co-operation of birds and fish schools and draws heavily from the evolutionary behavior of these organisms. This paper serves to provide a thorough survey of the PSO algorithm with special emphasis on the development, deployment, and improvements of its most basic as well as some of the very recent state-of-the-art implementations. Concepts and directions on choosing the inertia weight, constriction factor, cognition and social weights and perspectives on convergence, parallelization, elitism, niching and discrete optimization as well as neighborhood topologies are outlined. Hybridization attempts with other evolutionary and swarm paradigms in selected applications are covered and an up-to-date review is put forward for the interested reader.},

@article{Kramer2022a,
abstract = {Plants exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations show an increased photosynthetic activity. However, after prolonged exposure, the activity declines. This acclimation to elevated CO2 is accompanied by a rise in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the biomass. Hence, increased sugar accumulation and sequential downregulation of photosynthetic genes, as well as nitrogen depletion and reduced protein content, have been hypothesized as the cause of low photosynthetic performance. However, the reason for reduced nitrogen content in plants at high CO2 is unclear. Here, we show that reduced photorespiration at increased CO2-to-O2 ratio leads to reduced de novo assimilation of nitrate, thus shifting the C/N balance. Metabolic modeling of acclimated and non-acclimated plants revealed the photorespiratory pathway to function as a sink for already assimilated nitrogen during the light period, providing carbon skeletons for de novo assimilation. At high CO2, low photorespiratory activity resulted in diminished nitrogen assimilation and eventually resulted in reduced carbon assimilation. For the hpr1-1 mutant, defective in reduction of hydroxy-pyruvate, metabolic simulations show that turnover of photorespiratory metabolites is expanded into the night. Comparison of simulations for hpr1-1 with those for the wild type allowed investigating the effect of a perturbed photorespiration on N-assimilation.},
