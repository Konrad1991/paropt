# paropt

Parameter Optimizing of ODEs

The package *paropt* is build in order to optimize parameters of ode-systems. Thus, the aim is that the output of the integration matches previously measured states. The user has to supply an ode-system in the form of a Rcpp-function or as a C++ function. The information about states and parameters are passed via data.frames. Additional information such as e.g. the relative tolerance are passed in R.

# Overview

The package *paropt* uses a particle swarm optimizer ('https://github.com/kthohr/optim') in order to find a global best solution. Furthermore, in order to evaluate each particle during optimzation four different solvers can be used all derived from SUNDIALS ('https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials'). For more details see vignette. 

# Example

```{Rcpp, echo = F}
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::NumericVector ode_system(double t, std::vector<double> params,
                               Rcpp::NumericVector states) {
  
  // set dimension of vector which should be returned
  Rcpp::NumericVector states_deriv(2); //two states in the example above (prey and predator)
  
  // store parameters in variables
  double a = params[0];
  double b = params[1];
  double c = params[2];
  double d = params[3];
  
  // store states in variables
  double predator = states[0]; 
  double prey = states[1]; 
  
  // the actual ode-system            
  double ddtpredator = states_deriv[0] = predator*c*prey - predator*d;
  double ddtprey = states_deriv[1] = prey*a - prey*b*predator;
  
  return states_deriv;
}

# Acknowledgment

I would like to thank all the people who supported me writing this R-Package.
First of all I'm very greatful to my supervisor Arnd Heyer who supported me in writing the package.
Also I would like to thank Satyaprakash Nayak which gave me inspiration to solve coding problems.
Moreover, I would like to thank Tobias Bartsch for elaborately testing of the package.
Furthermore, gratitude is owned to Johannes KrÃ¤mer for many discussion about simulations. 
Special thanks to my girlfriend Jana for supporting me all the way.
