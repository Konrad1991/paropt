# paropt

Parameter Optimizing of ODEs

The package *paropt* is build in order to optimize parameters of ode-systems. Thus, the aim is that the output of the integration matches previously measured states. The user has to supply an ode-system in the form of a Rcpp-function. The information about states and parameters are passed via text-files. Additional information such as e.g. the relative tolerance are passed in R.

# Overview

The package *paropt* uses a particle swarm optimizer ('https://github.com/kthohr/optim') in order to find a global best solution. Furthermore, in order to evaluate each particle during optimzation four different solvers can be used all derived from SUNDIALS ('https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials'). For more details see vignette. 

# Example

```{r, echo = F}
path <- system.file("examples", package = "paropt")
setwd(path)
library(paropt)
Rcpp::sourceCpp(paste(path,"/ode.cpp", sep = ""))
df <- read.table(paste(path,"/states_LV.txt", sep = ""), header = TRUE)
time <- df$time
param_start <- "start.txt"
param_lb <- "lb.txt"
param_ub <- "ub.txt"
states <- "states_LV.txt"
state_output <- "final_stateoutput.txt"
par_output <- "optimized_params.txt"
set.seed(1)
optimizer(time, ode, 1e-6, c(1e-8, 1e-8),
         param_start, param_lb, param_ub,
         states, npop = 40, ngen = 200, error = 1,
         state_output, par_output, "bdf")
df_in_silico <- read.table(paste(path, "/final_stateoutput.txt", sep = ""), header = TRUE)
plot(df$time, df$n1, pch = 19, main = "predator", ylab = "predator", xlab = "time")
points(df_in_silico$time, df_in_silico$n1, pch = 19, col = "darkred")
legend(1, 26, legend = c("measured", "in silico"),
col = c("black", "darkred"),lty = 1:2, cex = 0.8) 
plot(df$time, df$n2, pch = 19, main = "prey",ylab = "prey", xlab = "time")
points(df_in_silico$time, df_in_silico$n2, pch = 19, col = "darkred")
legend(1, 26, legend = c("measured", "in silico"),
col = c("black", "darkred"),lty = 1:2, cex = 0.8)
```


# Acknowledgment

I would like to thank all the people who supported me writing this R-Package.
First of all I'm very greatful to my supervisor Arnd Heyer who supported me in writing the package.
Also I would like to thank Satyaprakash Nayak which gave me inspiration to solve coding problems.
Moreover, I would like to thank Tobias Bartsch for elaborately testing of the package.
Furthermore, gratitude is owned to Johannes KrÃ¤mer for many discussion about simulations. 
Special thanks to my girlfriend Jana for supporting me all the way.
