# paropt

Parameter Optimizing of ODEs

The package *paropt* is build in order to optimize parameters of ode-systems. Thus, the aim is that the output of the integration matches previously measured states. The user has to supply an ode-system in the form of a Rcpp-function. The information about states and parameters are passed via text-files. Additional information such as e.g. the relative tolerance are passed in R.

# Overview

The package *paropt* uses a particle swarm optimizer ('https://github.com/kthohr/optim') in order to find a global best solution. Furthermore, in order to evaluate each particle during optimzation four different solvers can be used all derived from SUNDIALS ('https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials'). For more details see vignette. 

# Example

```Rcpp
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
// [[Rcpp::depends(paropt)]]
// [[Rcpp::plugins(cpp11)]]

typedef int (*OS)(double &t, std::vector<double> &params, std::vector<double> &states);

int ode_system(double &t, std::vector<double> &params, std::vector<double> & states) {
  // define parameters
  double a = params[0];
  double b = params[1];
  double c = params[2];
  double d = params[3];
  
  double n1 = states[0];
  double n2 = states[1];
  
  states[0] = n1*c*n2 - n1*d;
  states[1] = n2*a - n2*b*n1;
  
  return 0;
}

  return Rcpp::List::create(f(integration_times,
                              xpfun,

# Further plans

- Add different error calculation
- Give users the possibility to use their own spline (at least in the Rcpp-Interface)

# Acknowledgment

I would like to thank all the people who supported me writing this R-Package.
First of all I'm very greatful to my supervisor Arnd Heyer who supported me in writing the package.
Also I would like to thank Satyaprakash Nayak which gave me inspiration to solve coding problems.
Moreover, I would like to thank Tobias Bartsch for elaborately testing of the package.
Furthermore, gratitude is owned to Johannes KrÃ¤mer for many discussion about simulations. 
Special thanks to my girlfriend Jana for supporting me all the way.
