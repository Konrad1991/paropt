# paropt

Parameter Optimizing of ODEs

The package *paropt* is build in order to optimize parameters of ode-systems. Thus, the aim is that the output of the integration matches previously measured states. The user has to supply an ode-system in the form of a Rcpp-function. The information about states and parameters are passed via text-files. Additional information such as e.g. the relative tolerance are passed in R.

# Overview

The package *paropt* uses a modified particle swarm optimizer ('https://github.com/kthohr/optim') in order to find a global best solution. Furthermore, in order to evaluate each particle during optimzation four different solvers can be used all derived from SUNDIALS ('https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials'). For more details see vignette. 

# Installation

*paropt* can be installed in R using install.packages("paropt") in order to use the version which is on CRAN. If you want to use the github-version (which can be used in parallel) use 
remotes::install_github("Konrad1991/paropt", ref = "Rcpp-Interface") within R (below you can see an example showing a parallized version of the parameter optimization of the predator-prey model). 

# Example

```Rcpp
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
// [[Rcpp::depends(paropt)]]
// [[Rcpp::plugins(cpp11)]]

typedef int (*OS)(double &t, std::vector<double> &params, std::vector<double> &states);

int ode_system(double &t, std::vector<double> &params, std::vector<double> & states) {
  
  // do not use any R-Code or R-Objects if the optimzation should run in parallel.
  // Users have to guarantee that the function can be called by several threads in parallel
  // define parameters (vector params contain the parameter in the order as defined in the corresponding textfiles)
  double a = params[0];
  double b = params[1];
  double c = params[2];
  double d = params[3];
  
  // states have to be in the same order as specified in the textfile "states_LV.txt" (Otherwise the error-calculation does not work) 
  double n1 = states[0];
  double n2 = states[1];
  
  states[0] = n1*c*n2 - n1*d;
  states[1] = n2*a - n2*b*n1;
  
  return 0;
}


// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::XPtr<OS> test_optimization() {
  Rcpp::XPtr<OS> xpfun = Rcpp::XPtr<OS>(new OS(&ode_system));
  
  return xpfun;
}



/*** R
lb <- data.frame(time = 0, a = 0.8, b = 0.3, c = 0.09, d = 0.09)
ub <- data.frame(time = 0, a = 1.3, b = 0.7, c = 0.4, d = 0.7)

path <- system.file("examples", package = "paropt")
states <- read.table(paste(path,"/states_LV.txt", sep = ""), header = T)

library(paropt)
set.seed(1)
df <- optimizer_pointer(integration_times = states$time, ode_sys = test_optimization(),
                  relative_tolerance = 1e-6, absolute_tolerances = c(1e-8, 1e-8),
                  lower = lb, upper = ub, states = states, 
                  npop = 40, ngen = 30000, error = 0.0001, solvertype = "ADAMS")

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(states$time, df$States[,1], pch = 19)
points(states$time, states$n1, pch = 19, col = "darkred")
plot(states$time, df$States[,2], pch = 19)
points(states$time, states$n2, pch = 19, col = "darkred")

# Further plans

- Add different error calculations
- Give users the possibility to use their own spline (at least for the Rcpp-Interface)
- Update Documentation

# Acknowledgment

I would like to thank all the people who supported me writing this R-Package.
First of all I'm very greatful to my supervisor Arnd Heyer who supported me in writing the package.
Also I would like to thank Satyaprakash Nayak which gave me inspiration to solve coding problems.
Moreover, I would like to thank Tobias Bartsch for elaborately testing of the package.
Furthermore, gratitude is owned to Johannes KrÃ¤mer for many discussion about simulations. 
Special thanks to my girlfriend Jana for supporting me all the way.
