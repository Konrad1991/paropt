# paropt

Parameter Optimizing of ODEs

The package *paropt* is build in order to optimize parameters of ode-systems. Thus, the aim is that the output of the integration matches previously measured states. The user has to supply an ode-system in the form of an R or Rcpp function. In case it is an R function the code is translated into C++ code (example can be seen below). 

The information about states and parameters are passed as data.frames. Additional information such as e.g. the relative tolerance are passed in R.

# Overview

The package *paropt* uses a modified particle swarm optimizer ('https://github.com/kthohr/optim') in order to find a global best solution. Furthermore, in order to evaluate each particle during optimzation four different solvers can be used all derived from SUNDIALS ('https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials'). For more details see vignette. 

# Installation

*paropt* can be installed in R using install.packages("paropt") in order to use the version which is on CRAN. If you want to use the github-version (which can be used in parallel) use
remotes::install_github("Konrad1991/paropt") within R (below you can see an example showing a parallized version of the parameter optimization of the predator-prey model).

# Example

```R
remotes::install_github("Konrad1991/paropt", force = TRUE)

library(paropt)

ode <- function(t, parameter, y, ydot) {
  
  a_db = at(parameter, 1)
  b_db = at(parameter, 2)
  c_db = at(parameter, 3)
  d_db = at(parameter, 4)
  
  predator_db = at(y,1)
  prey_db = at(y, 2)
  
  ydot[1] = predator_db*prey_db*c_db - predator_db*d_db
  ydot[2] = prey_db*a_db - prey_db*predator_db*b_db
}

# Further plans

- Add different error calculations
- Give users the possibility to use different interpolation functions. 

# Acknowledgment

I would like to thank all the people who supported me writing this R-Package.
First of all I'm very greatful to my supervisor Arnd Heyer who supported me in writing the package.
Also I would like to thank Satyaprakash Nayak which gave me inspiration to solve coding problems.
Moreover, I would like to thank Tobias Bartsch for elaborately testing of the package.
Furthermore, gratitude is owned to Johannes KrÃ¤mer for many discussion about simulations.
Special thanks to my girlfriend Jana for supporting me all the way.
